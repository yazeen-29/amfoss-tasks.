What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?


Truely amazing, as a selection process it stands differnt. i think the main idea of praveshan is self learn, it shows us that a laptop and an internet connection can make huge things if the person infront of it have the urge for it. for myself, before praveshan i know only python but for praveshan i studied many thing like htmal,css,js,opencv,mysql and above that the mind to work for what we aim. eventhough i was not able to complete all the task but i managed to do some but the learnings i get from the process will always make me better.i have gaven my best in what all i have done in making it up to the standards
